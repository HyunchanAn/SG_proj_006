NeurIPS - Open Polymer Prediction 2025
Predicting polymer properties with machine learning to accelerate sustainable materials research.


NeurIPS - Open Polymer Prediction 2025

Late Submission
Dataset Description
In this competition, your task is to use polymer structure data (SMILES) to predict five key chemical properties derived from molecular dynamics simulation: glass transition temperature (Tg), fractional free volume (FFV), thermal conductivity (Tc), polymer density, and radius of gyration (Rg). Successfully predicting these properties is crucial for scientists to accelerate the design of novel polymers with targeted characteristics, which can be used in various applications.

This competition uses a hidden test set. When your submitted notebook is scored, the actual test data will be made available to your notebook. Expect approximately 1,500 polymers in the hidden test set.
